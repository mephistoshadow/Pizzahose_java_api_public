Should give a reflection on how it went, and what you liked and disliked about this process:
The process of the pair programming invovle a lot of discussions and in person meetings. We pick 3 days that are available for both of us to discuss the design pattern, how the overall structure if the project should be, and how we should start coding the project.
In the process, we found discussion will help us to solve many donfusions from reading the assignment handout. We will ask/search on piazza when we feel confuse and unsure.
Disliked about the process is that we spend a lot of time convince each other about the design pattern, how to code the project, what is the type of the attributes, etc. We took a long time to conmunicate with each other what we have done and the input, output of functions.
